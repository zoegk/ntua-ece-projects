### Machine Learning 

This repository contains two machine learning projects focused on different applications:

1. **Rain Prediction Model**: The rain prediction model project focuses on developing a machine learning model to forecast whether it will rain the next day. Utilizing historical weather data, including atmospheric conditions, temperature, humidity, and precipitation patterns, participants preprocess data, select relevant features, and train a predictive model. 

2. **Hyperspectral Image Analysis**: This project explores the analysis of hyperspectral images using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the k-Means clustering method and PCA dimensionality reduction, participants delve into tasks such as loading and preprocessing hyperspectral images, visualizing and exploring the data, identifying spectral signatures of different materials, and applying clustering algorithms for image segmentation. The project provides practical experience in handling and analyzing hyperspectral data, with applications in fields such as remote sensing, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.

Through these projects, participants gain hands-on experience in applying machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems and understand the intricacies of working with diverse datasets and domains.
