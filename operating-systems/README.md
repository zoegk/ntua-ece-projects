# Operating Systems
Welcome to the Operating Systems repository, dedicated to the class curriculum covering essential topics in operating systems. Here, you'll find reports and code examples focusing on key concepts such as process management, synchronization, parallel computation, and virtual memory management.

Explore process management, from constructing predefined and arbitrary process trees to understanding signal handling and parallel computation of numerical expressions.

Dive into synchronization techniques, including coordination mechanisms and parallel computation strategies, such as the Mandelbrot set computation with processes and semaphores.

Gain insights into virtual memory management, system calls, and the fundamental mechanisms of the operating system for efficient resource allocation and management.

_Note: Don't forget to include the helper functions when needed. Make sure they are in the same folder or accessible from the code._
