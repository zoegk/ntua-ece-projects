# Digital Signal Processing

This repository contains two projects for digital signal processing. These projects delve into various aspects of DSP, focusing on topics such as spectral analysis, sine detection using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), telephone touch-tones, short-time characteristics of voice and music signals, psychoacoustic models, and time-frequency analysis with an array of bandpass filters.
