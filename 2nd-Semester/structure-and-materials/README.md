# Structure and Electrical Properties of Materials

This part of the repository contains three sets of exercises designed to delve into semiconductor analysis and related concepts.

1. **Semiconductor Analysis in Octave**: Solve equations and create plots in Octave to understand semiconductor properties.
   
2. **Conductivity-Resistance-Hall Effect**: Investigate conductivity, resistance, and the Hall effect's influence on semiconductors. Analyze and visualize key phenomena.

3. **Forward and Reverse Bias in PN Junction and Metal-Semiconductor Junction**: Study PN junction and metal-semiconductor junction behavior under various bias conditions. Solve equations and plot characteristics to deepen understanding.
