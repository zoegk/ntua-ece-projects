;Init Stack Pointer
ldi r24, LOW(RAMEND)  ; Load the lower byte of the RAMEND address into register r24.
out SPL, r24  ; Store the value of r24 into the Stack Pointer Low register.
ldi r24, HIGH(RAMEND)  ; Load the higher byte of the RAMEND address into register r24.
out SPH, r24  ; Store the value of r24 into the Stack Pointer High register.

start:
ldi leds, 0x01  ; Load the value 0x01 (binary 00000001) into the 'leds' register.

;Init PORTD as output
ser temp  ; Set all bits of the 'temp' register to 1.
out DDRD, temp  ; Configure all pins of PORTD as output.

ldi r24, low(F1)  ; Load the lower byte of F1 into register r24.
ldi r25, high(F1)  ; Load the higher byte of F1 into register r25. Set delay.

left:
out PORTD, leds  ; Output the value of 'leds' to PORTD, turning on the corresponding LEDs.
sbrc leds,0  ; Skip the next instruction if the least significant bit (LSB) of 'leds' is clear (not set).
rcall delay_outer  ; Call the delay_outer subroutine to create a delay.

; The following two rcall delay_outer instructions introduce an intentional delay to control the speed of the LED movement.

rcall delay_outer  ; Call the delay_outer subroutine to create a delay.
lsl leds  ; Logical shift left the value of 'leds', effectively shifting the LEDs to the left.
sbrs leds,7  ; Skip the next instruction if the most significant bit (MSB) of 'leds' is set.
rjmp left  ; Jump back to the 'left' label.

right:
out PORTD, leds  ; Output the value of 'leds' to PORTD, turning on the corresponding LEDs.
sbrc leds,7  ; Skip the next instruction if the MSB of 'leds' is clear.
rcall delay_outer  ; Call the delay_outer subroutine to create a delay.

; The following two rcall delay_outer instructions introduce an intentional delay to control the speed of the LED movement.

rcall delay_outer  ; Call the delay_outer subroutine to create a delay.
lsr leds  ; Logical shift right the value of 'leds', effectively shifting the LEDs to the right.
sbrs leds, 0  ; Skip the next instruction if the LSB of 'leds' is set.
rjmp right  ; Jump back to the 'right' label.

rjmp left  ; Unconditional jump to the 'left' label.

; This routine is used to produce a delay of 993 cycles.
delay_inner:
ldi r23, 247  ; Load the value 247 into register r23.

loop3:
dec r23  ; Decrement the value of r23 by 1.
nop  ; No operation (1 cycle).

loop4:
rcall delay_inner  ; Call the delay_inner subroutine, which produces a delay of 993 cycles.
sbiw r24, 1  ; Subtract 1 from the 16-bit value formed by r24 and r25.
